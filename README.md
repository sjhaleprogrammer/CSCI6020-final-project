# 🗳️ Election Prediction API

Welcome to the **Election Prediction API**, a Flask-powered service that predicts the election outcome for a given state and year. The API uses pre-trained machine learning models to deliver accurate predictions, enabling insightful analyses.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Predict Election Outcomes**: 
  Predict whether a state leans *Republican* or *Democratic* for a specified year.
  
- **Dynamic Model Integration**: 
  Plug in various ML models and preprocessors seamlessly.

- **State and Year Filters**: 
  Use state and year data to refine predictions.

- **Error Handling**:
  Built-in robust validation and user-friendly error messages.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9** or above
- **Deps in Requirments.txt**


---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/election-prediction-api.git
   cd election-prediction-api
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Prepare your models and data:
   - Place your pre-trained models and preprocessors in the `models/` directory.
   - Add your processed dataset (e.g., `all_states_prediction.csv`) to the `data_processed/` directory.

## 🏃‍♂️ Run the API

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   flask --app frontend/app.py run
   ```

2. Access the API at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## 📖 Example Use Case

Imagine you're a political analyst preparing for an election year. Using this API, you can:
- Quickly assess the likelihood of a state leaning Democratic or Republican.
- Integrate predictions into dashboards or visualizations.

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- Add support for more advanced ML models (e.g., neural networks).
- Introduce visual dashboards for predictions.
- Expand dataset support for county-level predictions.
